# Portfolio Presentation Slides

This presentation depicts shifts within African elephant populations, covering data collected by the African Elephant Specialist Group (AfESG) of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. I created these slides to fulfill a presentation assignment for my Data Analysis course, which required me to choose a dataset of my interest and prepare five slides in R that presented details about the data, one solo visualization, and two additional visualizations displayed on the same slide with the patchwork package. I chose to isolate data and prepare a presentation about elephant populations within Africa because they are my favorite animal and my regions of academic interest lie within sub-Saharan Africa. 

Within this repository, you may access the presentation (6 slides), the AfESG CSV data file, and the replication Rmd file.
